        <h1>Lyssara</h1>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The Royal House of Lyssara</b> <a href="../People/Leaders_Of_Lyssara/Sea_Queen_Amara_Tideborn.html">The Sea Queen</a> At the head of Lyssara’s political structure is
            <a href="../People/Leaders_Of_Lyssara/Sea_Queen_Amara_Tideborn.html">The Sea Queen</a>, the monarch who rules from the capital city of Seabright. The Sea King or
            Queen is the supreme authority in Lyssara, responsible for overseeing the kingdom’s military,
            trade, and diplomacy. The monarch’s power is balanced by the Council of Admirals and the
            Merchant’s Assembly, ensuring that the interests of both the navy and the mercantile class are
            represented.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Royal Court <a href="../People/Leaders_Of_Lyssara/Sea_Queen_Amara_Tideborn.html">The Sea Queen</a> is supported by a royal court composed of advisors,
            ministers, and noble families who manage the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom. Key positions
            include the Lord of the Fleet, who oversees the navy, the Master of Trade, who manages commerce
            and economic policy, and the Keeper of the Waves, who is responsible for coastal defenses and
            infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Council of Admirals</b> The Council of Admirals is a powerful body that advises the Sea King or
            Queen on military and naval matters. It is composed of the highest-ranking admirals in Lyssara’s
            navy, each responsible for a different region or fleet. The council plays a crucial role in
            shaping naval strategy, overseeing shipbuilding, and planning expeditions. The Council of
            Admirals is highly influential, as Lyssara’s strength and security are closely tied to its
            control of the seas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The Merchant’s Assembly</b> Given Lyssara’s mercantile nature, the Merchant’s Assembly is a vital
            part of the kingdom’s governance. This body represents the interests of the merchant class,
            guilds, and trade houses that drive Lyssara’s economy. The assembly is made up of
            representatives from the major port cities, merchant families, and trade guilds. The assembly
            has the power to influence trade policies, tariffs, and regulations, and it works closely with
            the royal court to ensure that Lyssara remains a dominant force in regional commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Regional Structure</b> Port Cities and Governing Councils Lyssara is divided into several key port
            cities, each with its own governing council. These councils are composed of local nobles,
            merchant leaders, and representatives from the navy. The councils manage local governance,
            trade, and defense within their respective cities and territories. While <a href="../People/Leaders_Of_Lyssara/Sea_Queen_Amara_Tideborn.html">The Sea Queen</a>
            holds ultimate authority, the port cities enjoy a high degree of autonomy, reflecting Lyssara’s
            emphasis on regional commerce and naval strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coastal Territories and Nobility Beyond the major port cities, Lyssara’s coastal territories are
            governed by a network of noble families loyal to the crown. These nobles manage the hinterlands,
            oversee smaller coastal towns, and ensure the protection of the kingdom’s shores. They are
            responsible for raising local militias, maintaining lighthouses, and managing agricultural
            production, particularly in regions where fishing and shipbuilding are vital industries.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Guilds and Trade Houses</b> Trade Guilds Lyssara’s economy is heavily influenced by trade guilds,
            each specializing in different aspects of commerce, such as shipbuilding, textiles, spices, or
            exotic goods. These guilds regulate their respective industries, set quality standards, and
            manage trade routes. The guilds are influential in both the Merchant’s Assembly and the port
            city councils, and they play a key role in shaping Lyssara’s economic policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Noble Trade Houses In addition to the guilds, several noble trade houses wield significant power
            in Lyssara. These houses, often descended from the kingdom’s founding families, control vast
            fleets of merchant ships and have extensive trade networks. They compete with one another for
            lucrative contracts and influence within the royal court, and their fortunes are closely tied to
            the kingdom’s prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Naval and Military Structure</b> The Royal Navy The Royal Navy is the pride of Lyssara and the
            cornerstone of its power. It is divided into several fleets, each commanded by an admiral who
            reports directly to the Council of Admirals. The navy is responsible for protecting Lyssara’s
            coasts, securing trade routes, and conducting naval expeditions. The navy’s influence extends
            beyond military matters, as it also plays a role in exploration and diplomacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Coastal Guard To defend the kingdom’s shores and harbors, Lyssara maintains a Coastal Guard,
            a specialized force tasked with patrolling coastal waters, protecting fishing fleets, and
            guarding against piracy. The Coastal Guard works closely with local militias and naval forces to
            ensure the security of Lyssara’s maritime interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Legal System and Justice</b> The Admiralty Court Given Lyssara’s maritime focus, the Admiralty Court
            handles legal matters related to the sea, including disputes over trade, piracy, and naval
            conduct. The court is composed of judges appointed by <a href="../People/Leaders_Of_Lyssara/Sea_Queen_Amara_Tideborn.html">The Sea Queen</a>, with expertise in
            maritime law. It has jurisdiction over all naval and trade-related cases, making it a critical
            institution in the kingdom’s justice system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local Magistrates Each port city and coastal territory has its own magistrates who handle local
            legal matters, including civil disputes, criminal cases, and commercial contracts. These
            magistrates are appointed by the governing councils and operate under the guidance of the royal
            court. In regions where the Merchant’s Assembly holds sway, merchant law often plays a
            significant role in legal proceedings.
