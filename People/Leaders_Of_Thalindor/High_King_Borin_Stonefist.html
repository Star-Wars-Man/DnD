            <b>Appearance:</b> Borin is a towering figure with a powerful build, a testament to his years as a warrior. His hair and beard
            are iron-gray, neatly braided in the <a href="../../Kingdoms/Thalindor.html">Thalindorian</a> style, with a crown forged
            from the finest metals of the kingdom. He often wears ornate armor, crafted in his own forges, which is both practical
