            <b>Background:</b> Lady Brienne hails from a long line of noble knights who have served as the protectors of Starfall Keep, a fortress situated in the northernmost region of the kingdom. The Starfall family is renowned for their vigilance and courage, tasked with defending the kingdom's northern borders from external threats and safeguarding the passages through the rugged mountains. Brienne inherited the mantle of leadership after her father’s death in battle, taking up the family’s ancient sword, Starseeker, as both a symbol of her lineage and her duty.
