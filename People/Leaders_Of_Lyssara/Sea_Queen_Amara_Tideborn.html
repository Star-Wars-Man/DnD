        <h1>Sea Queen Amara Tideborn</h1>
        <p>
            Title: Sea Queen of <a href="../../Kingdoms/Lyssara.html">Lyssara</a>, Mistress of the Azure Throne
        </p>
        <p>
            Background: Amara Tideborn hails from one of <a href="../../Kingdoms/Lyssara.html">Lyssara</a>'s oldest and most revered 
            noble families, known for their long history of naval command and exploration. She rose to prominence as a naval 
            strategist and captain, leading successful expeditions that expanded <a href="../../Kingdoms/Lyssara.html">Lyssara's</a>
            influence across the seas. Her brilliance in both diplomacy and warfare earned her the crown when the previous king,
            her father, passed away without a male heir. Amara's reign has been marked by a strengthening of
            <a href="../../Kingdoms/Lyssara.html">Lyssara</a>'s naval power and an expansion of its trade networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personality: Amara is known for her keen intellect, unwavering resolve, and charismatic leadership. She is a formidable
            strategist with a deep understanding of naval warfare, but she also possesses a diplomatic touch that allows her to
            navigate the treacherous waters of politics. Her subjects admire her for her fairness, while her rivals respect
            (and fear) her for her cunning. Despite her often stern exterior, Amara has a genuine love for the sea and frequently
            joins her fleet on voyages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Appearance: Amara is in her early forties, with striking sea-green eyes that seem to mirror the ocean itself. Her long,
            dark hair is often braided and adorned with pearls and coral, reflecting her connection to the sea. She dresses in
            elegant, functional clothing suited for both court and ship, favoring shades of blue and silver. A distinct feature of
            her attire is the Crown of Tides, a circlet crafted from silver and adorned with sapphires and seashells, symbolizing
            her dominion over the seas.
