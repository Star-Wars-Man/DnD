            Known as the "Iron Lion," he has expanded <a href="../../Kingdoms/Varanthia.html">Varanthia</a>'s borders and fortified

            Personality: King Aldric is a firm yet just ruler, revered for his honor and commitment to his people. He values
            strength, discipline, and loyalty above all, and expects the same from his knights and subjects. While he can be
            ruthless to his enemies, he is also known for his deep sense of duty and fairness.

            Appearance: Aldric is a tall, imposing figure with broad shoulders and a commanding presence. His steel-gray eyes and
            graying hair give him a regal, authoritative look. He often wears ornate armor bearing the crest of
